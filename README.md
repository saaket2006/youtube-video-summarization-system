# 🎥 Multi-Agentic YouTube Video Summarization Tool Powered by Whisper and LLMs

AI-Based YouTube Summarization System

This project is an AI-powered end-to-end system designed to automatically generate structured, clean, and academically styled summaries of YouTube videos. By combining transcript extraction, audio transcription, chunking, multi-agent processing, translation, and validation, the system produces high-quality summaries suitable for research, learning, and revision. Users only provide a YouTube URL and an optional translation preference, and the system handles the complete pipeline, including post-summary Q&A using the final content.

Problem Statement

YouTube hosts a vast amount of educational and technical content, but much of it is lengthy, unstructured, and time-consuming to consume. Many videos lack accurate transcripts, and manually extracting key concepts or converting them into structured notes is a tedious process. Learners and professionals often need reliable, concise insights without spending hours watching video content. Moreover, multilingual audiences face the added challenge of understanding videos published only in a single language.

Solution Statement

The AI-Based YouTube Summarization System solves these issues by providing an automated, multi-agent approach that transforms YouTube content into high-quality summaries. The system retrieves or transcribes the video, cleans and chunks the text, processes it through parallel formatter and summarizer agents, merges results into a final structured summary, and optionally translates it. A validator agent ensures correctness and readability, and a Q&A agent answers follow-up questions. This solution drastically reduces consumption time, eliminates manual summarization effort, and provides accessible multilingual output.

Architecture

The architecture is composed of multiple agents and utility layers that work together in a clean, modular pipeline:

Transcript Retrieval Layer

transcript_utils: Loads official YouTube transcripts when available.

whisper_utils: Performs Whisper audio transcription when transcripts are unavailable.

Chunking Layer

chunk_utils: Splits long transcripts into smaller text segments.

batch_chunks: Organizes these segments into manageable batches for parallel processing.

Formatter Agent

Cleans transcript chunks, fixes grammar, restructures sentences, and improves readability.

Chunk Summarizer Agent

Summarizes each cleaned chunk independently.

Ensures clarity, structure, and removal of unnecessary content.

Final Summarizer Agent

Aggregates all chunk summaries.

Produces a polished, section-wise final summary.

Translator Agent

Converts the final English summary into the user’s selected language.

Preserves headings, bullets, and markdown structure.

Validator Agent

Performs correctness, coherence, and structural validation of the final summary.

Ensures that the content meets academic-style requirements.

Q&A Agent

Allows users to ask follow-up questions.

Responds using the final summary as the contextual knowledge base.

Workflow

The workflow describes how the system processes user input from start to end:

Step 1: User provides YouTube URL and selects translation mode.

Step 2: System extracts video ID and attempts transcript retrieval.

Step 3: If transcript is unavailable, Whisper performs audio transcription.

Step 4: Transcript is chunked into smaller text batches.

Step 5: Parallel processing begins:

Formatter Agent cleans each chunk.

Chunk Summarizer Agent generates chunk-level summaries.

Step 6: All chunk summaries are aggregated and merged.

Step 7: Final Summarizer Agent produces a complete structured summary.

Step 8: If translation is enabled, Translator Agent converts the summary into the chosen language.

Step 9: Validator Agent checks the final output for quality and formatting.

Step 10: Streamlit UI displays the summary and enables the Q&A interaction.

Step 11: Q&A Agent responds to user queries using the summary as context.
